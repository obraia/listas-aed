Fly Away With Me

I'm strummin on the corner
About to catch the last train home
I'll have to jump the barriers
So can you spare a penny for my thoughts?
I've been praised upon the pavements
Passers by don't pay much
Chased away by neighbors
Seen things you couldn't make up
If the streets could talk
They'd tell a story or two
I'll paint a picture for you

I can tell you what it feels like
To lose your home on a cold night
Can you see the blood in my red eyes?
Have another total forget life

So come on fly away with me
To a place where we could be anyone we wanna be
And we can bottle up our fears
Brew a taste so sweet
Knock us off our feet or more
Burn our troubles
Inhale them all
Paint our future on a fractured wall
So come on fly away with me
To a place where we can be anyone we wanna be

Still in the station when I wake up
I missed the last train home
Jump back over the barriers
No ones got a penny for my flaws
I'ma sleep upon the pavement
Passers by don't say much
Tutted at by strangers
Dreamt things you'd never dream of
If these streets could talk
They'd tell a story or two
I'll paint a picture for you

I can tell you what it feels like
To lose something you love on a cold night
As the cars roll by under the street lights
There's only one way I can forget life

So come on fly away with me
To a place where we could be anyone we wanna be
And we can bottle up our fears
Brew a taste so sweet
Knock us off our feet or more
Burn our troubles inhale them all
Paint our future on a fractured wall
So come on fly away with me
To a place where we can be anyone we wanna be

We could be anyone we wanna be
(Ohh-oh, ohh-oh)
We could be anyone we wanna be

And these streets I'm walking
They started talking to me, oh-oh
Can't you see? Yeah-ay, yeah
There's only one way outta here
We have to face the things we fear
And we could be anyone we wanna be
Yeah we could be anyone we wanna be

So come on fly away with me
To a place where we could be anyone we wanna be
And we can bottle up our fears
Brew a taste so sweet
knock us off our feet or more
Burn our troubles inhale them all
Paint our future on a fractured wall
So come on fly away with me
To a place where we can be anyone we wanna be

We could be anyone we wanna be
(Ohh-oh, ohh-oh)
We could be anyone we wanna be
